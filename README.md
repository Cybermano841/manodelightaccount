### MY EXPERIENCE MAKING THE ACCOUNTS

When creating the accounts i realized it's not something to rush although it took time ,but i was patience enough to avoid making mistakes, i did not have any challenges when making the accounts or while using a fuction.

At first, when learning the fuctions some were a bit confusing like using the **Right** and **Left** function but with enough pratice i became very familar with it and understood the fuction.
So now i can confidently say i'm improving in using Excel

### Stuructures of Data
I learnt about the different structures of data which are;

- Structured Data
  
  Involves the use of Tables
  |NAME|GENDER|AGE|MARITAL STATUS|
  |----|------|---|--------------|
  |Mano|Female|16|Single|
  |peace|Female|20|Married|
  |Henry|Male|25|Divorced|
  |Abigail|Shemale|32|Single|
  
- Semi structured Data

This uses makers like quotations , comma ,etc
Examples are JSV,XML
  
- Unstructured data

It has no particular format but takes the form of Audio, videos and pictures
